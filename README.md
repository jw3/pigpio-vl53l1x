ST VL53L1X API implementation for pigpio
===

Using VL53L1X API [v2.3.3](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/proximity-sensors-software/stsw-img007.html)

### driver

The `example/driver` executable will perform a simple usage of the sensor

Can pass in the timing budget and interval (both in ms) as arg 1 and 2 respectively

So for example, `driver 20 24`


### java bindings

The Travis build publishes a JNA based Java API for this driver to bintray

### ranging modes [\[reference\]](https://community.st.com/s/question/0D50X00009XkWSGSA3/vl53l1x-timing-issue)
- VL53L1_PRESETMODE_LITE_RANGING
  - Does a range A; Provides result;  does a range B; provides Result
  - Needs the VL53L1_ClearInterruptAndStartMeasurement to continue
  - 10ms min timing budget in SHORT mode, 16ms with LONG mode
  - This is best for predictable timing. But the timing here is for only the range A or B, not both
- VL53L1_PRESETMODE_AUTONOMOUS
  - Does a range A, then range B
  - Needs the VL53L1_ClearInterruptAndStartMeasurement to continue
  - 46ms min timing budget
- VL53L1_PRESETMODE_LOWPOWER_AUTONOMOUS
  - Does range A, then B
  - No need to read or clear the interrup, will continue to range
  - 20ms min timing budget
  - Intermeasurement period should be 5ms longer than the timing budget

For consistent timing and the fastest results use LITE_RANGING mode.

### investigate
- SignalRateRtnMegaCps
  - Return signal rate (MCPS)\n these is a 16.16 fix point value, which is effectively a measure of target reflectance.
- AmbientRateRtnMegaCps
  - Return ambient rate (MCPS)\n these is a 16.16 fix point value, which is effectively a measure of the ambient light.
- RangeQualityLevel
  - indicate a quality level in percentage from 0 to 100
  - Not yet supported by ST API
- VL53L1_SetDeviceAddress
  - divides the specified address by two
